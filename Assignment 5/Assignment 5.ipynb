    "**Sample:**\n",
    "A dilute solution (nanomolar range) containing the two species is prepared on a coverslip or within a sealed chamber. The low concentration is crucial for ensuring that only a few molecules reside in the focal volume at any given time.\n",

    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The objective lens must have a high numerical aperture (ideally NA > 0.9) in order to focus the laser light to a sufficiently small focal volume to ensure the number of simultaneously detected particles is not too large. Water immersion objectives are often used.\n",
